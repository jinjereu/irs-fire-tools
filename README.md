### In-App Messaging

Firebase In-App Messaging allows you to send relevant, contextual messages to users 
with the main objective of encouraging app users to engage more with an app's key features.

See here for more on [Firebase In-App Messaging]: (https://firebase.google.com/docs/in-app-messaging/)

Here are the steps to integrate In-App Messaging:
* [Setup Firebase Project, Add Firebase to the Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
* [Add the Firebase In-App Messaging SDK to your project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/in-app-messaging/get-started)  

Note: We have excluded the GoogleService-Info.plist file as this contains our APIKeys and other credentials. Obtain this from your Firebase Console.
